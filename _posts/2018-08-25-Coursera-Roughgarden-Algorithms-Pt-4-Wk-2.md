## Quiz

### P1
![img]({{ '/assets/images/20180825/Algorithms-pt4-wk2-ex1.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

NP-Complete problems are either all not solvable in polynomial time, or all solvable in polynomial time.  There is no way for there to be some NP-Complete problems to be polynomial-time solvable. 

### P2
![img]({{ '/assets/images/20180825/Algorithms-pt4-wk2-ex2.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

TSP1 reduces to TSP2 and HAM1 reduces to HAM2.  As such, if either TSP2 or HAM2 are polynomial-time solvable, then so are TSP1 and HAM1 respectively.

### P3
![img]({{ '/assets/images/20180825/Algorithms-pt4-wk2-ex3.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

If cycles are allowed when finding the shortest path between s and t with exactly n-1 edges, then a polynomial-time solvable algorithm, such as a Bellman-Ford recurrence, can be used.


### P4
![img]({{ '/assets/images/20180825/Algorithms-pt4-wk2-ex4.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

Vertex covers and independent sets are complements of each other.  If you can solve one in **O(T(n))**{:.highlighted}, then so can the other.  So all three statements are true.

### P5
![img]({{ '/assets/images/20180825/Algorithms-pt4-wk2-ex5.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }

Deleting a vertex of a TSP represented by nodes whose edges are the euclidean distances between the nodes cannot increase the cost of the optimal tour.  Since the edges are euclidean distances, they'll all be nonnegative. Removing a vertex will result in one less vertex to visit and so the total distance of the optimal tour can only get smaller.

## Programming Assignment

For this assignment we need to solve the "Traveling Sales-man Problem", more specifically for a graph of 25 points:

An exponential, though better than pure brute force, algorithm using dynammic programming was presented in lecture:

To see how good/bad the algorithm was, I implemented it exactly as presented in c++.  Here it is below:

    vector<dataPoint*> V;
    
    double x,y;
    int id = 0;

    while (getline(infile, line)){
        
        vector<string> coors = split(line, ' ');

                        diff.erase(diff.begin() + j);

I created a quick dataPoint data structure for handling the data and computing euclidean distances between points:

{% highlight C++ linenos %}

/******************************************************************************/
/******************************************************************************/
/*  dataPoint Header                                                          */
/******************************************************************************/
/******************************************************************************/

#include <math.h>

class dataPoint {
public:
    
    dataPoint(int id, double x, double y);
    dataPoint(const dataPoint& d):dataPoint(d.getID(), d.getX(), d.getY()){}
    
    double distance(dataPoint other);
    int getID() const;
    double getX()  const;
    double getY()  const;
    
    bool operator==(const dataPoint& other);
    
private:
    const int ID;
    const double X, Y;
    
};

/******************************************************************************/

dataPoint::dataPoint(int id, double x, double y) : ID(id), X(x), Y(y){
}

double dataPoint::distance(dataPoint other) {
    return pow( pow((this->X - other.getX()), 2) 
              + pow((this->Y - other.getY()), 2), 0.5);
}

int dataPoint::getID() const {
    return ID;
}

}

    return Y;

bool dataPoint::operator==(const dataPoint& other) {
    return getID() == other.getID();
}

I also needed a way to generate subsets of a given set.  Doing some research online I found a clever way to do so using bit shifting.  The function that generates my subsets is below:

{% capture text-capture %}
>C++
{:.filename}
{% highlight C++ linenos %}

template <typename T>
map< int, vector<vector<T>>>  generateChoicesOfS(vector<T> set){
    map< int, vector<vector<T>>> result;
    vector<T> s;
    
    int n = set.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < (1<<n); i++){
        s.clear();
        
        //cycle through possible number of elements
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            
            if ((i & (1<<j)) > 0){
                s.push_back(set[j]);
            }
        }
        
        //skip empty set
        if (s.size() == 0)
            continue;
        
        //only take those that contain first element.
        if (s[0] == set[0]){
            result[s.size()].push_back(s);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}


{% endhighlight %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include widgets/toggle-field.html toggle-name="toggle-subsetgenerator" button-text="Subsets Generator" toggle-text=text-capture  footer="End of Subsets Generator"%}

The map it returns organizes the subsets by size.  So if I want all of the subsets with size of 3, just call the map with 3.  

As the algorithm is **O(n<sup>2</sup>2<sup>n</sup>)**{:.highlighted} the implementation takes an awful long time, around 2 hours of run time. Reading the forums on coursera some students discussed an excellent idea using "Divide and Conquer".  If you split the points into two halves, the algorithm is instant for each case.  Then, using the results of both half-problems, it's only a few checks away from constructing the optimal solution.  I would like to make a more general implementation of this method, I may return to this another day however as I have other things I need to work on.
