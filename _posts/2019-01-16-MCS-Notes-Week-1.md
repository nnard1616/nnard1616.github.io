# CS 484 Parallel Programming

---

## Lesson 1-1

### Components of a Processor
* To be able to effectively program a modern multiprocessor, we have to understand what it is made up of and how it came to be the way it is today.
* Must have optimal sequential programs before we can use parallel programming
* Need switches that turn on off automatically via voltage application
* Computers are made from some very simple components by putting a large number of them together *in interesting ways*{:.yhighlighted}, and *running them really fast*{:.yhighlighted}.
 
### Early History of Computers
* History be dank yo.

### Moores Law
* In one clock cycle: instruction is fetched from memory, operands fetched, arithmetic performed, results stored back.
 
### End of Moores Law and Parallelism
* Power limit due to temperature, and transistor limit due to close to atomic sizes
* We are in the early days of the Era of Parallel Computing!
### Peek into the Future
* The future is promising for parallel programmers
* Times are changing, ie innovation is becoming stagnant in terms of processors
* Those who can "get" parallel will have an advantage
* If killer parallel app doesn't arrive, progress on single multiprocessor chips will stall
* Complete "stasis" after 7-10-ish years, but then such things have been predicted before.

## Lesson 1-2

### Performance Via Complexity
* obstacles to speed:
    * long chain of gate delays
    * floating point computations
    * slow memory
    * virtual memory and paging
* Overcoming these obstacles can lead to significant increase in complexity, and can make performance difficult to predict and control.
* latency vs throughput and bandwidth
* Programming to avoid branch misprediction
    * when you have data dependent branches that are hard to predict:
        * see if you can convert them into non-branching code!
    * Conditional move instructions help, and normally compilers should do the right thing, but sometimes compilers aren't able to
    * For example:
        * Sum += expression that evaluates to data[c] if >128 or 0 otherwise;
        * Or, since there are only 255 possible values, pre-create a lookup table 
        * Sum += table[data[c]];

### Memory Access Challenges
* Memory is slow, one way to help alleviate this bottleneck is to have intermediary memory devices in between the processor and storage memory (chaches)

# CS 498 Cloud Computing Applications
 
---

## Goals 
* Understand what cloud computing is and why it is important.

* Cloudonmics
* Software defined architecture
* IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service

## Guiding Questions
* What is cloud computing and why is it important?
* Does using cloud computing save my companyâ€™s budget?
* What is Big Data?
* How do software defined architectures work?
* What makes virtualizing my computer infrastructure attractive?
