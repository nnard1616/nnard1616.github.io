# What is This? 
This is a blog where I document my projects and progress as a computer scientist/programmer/software engineer.

The theme of this blog is based on [jekyll-clean-dark](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark/).

# Who am I?
I am Nathan Nard, computer scientist in the making.  I received a BS in biology/chemistry in 2011 from University of Illinois and have since floundered around trying to find my place in the world.  I've recently come to really enjoy programming and hope to make a career out of it. I intend to receive a MS in computer science and start working for a challenging tech company by 2020.
