# CS 498 Cloud Computing Applications

---

## Goals 
* Learn about many “glue” technologies that enable access to clouds, such as web middleware, JSON, REST API, RPC, etc.
* Learn about the different levels of cloud services, that include: PaaS (Platform as a Service); SaaS (Software as a Service); MaaS (Metal as a Service); FaaS (Function as a Service (server-less architecture)); MBaaS (Mobile Backend as a Service)
* Understand the principles of load balancing.

## Key Concepts
* JSON
* REST
* RPC
* PaaS: Platform as a Service
* SaaS: Software as a Service
* MaaS : Metal as a Service
* FaaS: Function as a Service (server-less architecture)
* MBaaS: Mobile Backend as a Service
* Load balancing
* Server-less architecture
* Amazon lambda

## Guiding Questions
* What are some of the glue technologies that power today’s cloud computing based enterprise infrastructure?
* How would client-server architecture work in practice? What is remote procedure call?
* What does REST architecture signify and how does it work?
* How does PaaS offering work and how is it different from IaaS?
* What is Mobile Backend as a Service? How does it help a mobile app developer?
